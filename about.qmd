*I am a mathematics graduate currently employed under the Momentum program at CSIC. My work focuses on developing AI-based tools for the real-time management and optimization of deep geothermal resources. Previously, I completed a 9-month internship at DXC Technology, where I gained experience in data engineering by implementing an ETL pipeline and integrating OpenAI's API.*
