#### *Detection of Machine Translation Through Distributional Text Properties*  
**University of Alicante** · 2024 · [PDF available upon request]  

**Abstract:**  
This work develops automated methods to distinguish between human and machine-translated texts by analyzing linguistic patterns. The key components include:

- Analysis of Beam Search algorithm limitations in machine translation  
- Feature engineering using lexical diversity metrics and TF-IDF statistics  
- Comparative evaluation of logistic regression vs. tree-based models (CART, Random Forest)  
- Cross-domain testing with parallel corpora of varying lengths and topics  

**Key Finding:** Logistic regression using TF-IDF features achieved superior performance in detecting machine-translated content, particularly when trained on diverse text lengths and domains.
